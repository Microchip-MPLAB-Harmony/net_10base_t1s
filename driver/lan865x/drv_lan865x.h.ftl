      Performs a read procedure to the MAC / Phy registers
      <p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

    Description:
      Reads from the given register address.

    Preconditions:
      The client had to be successfully opened with DRV_LAN865X_Open.

    Parameters:
      idx           - the MAC-PHY instance number, starting with 0 for the first instance
      addr          - The 32 Bit register offset
      protected     - true, enables protected control data transmission (normal + inverted data). false, no protection feature is used
      rxCallback    - Pointer to a callback handler. May left NULL, but then the result of the read procedure will be lost.
      pTag          - Any pointer. Will be given back in given modifyCallback. May left NULL

    Returns:
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK                - Returned on success
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_NO_DRIVER         - Given idx parameter is out of range
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_PENDING           - MAC-PHY Driver is currently busy, try again later
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_EVENT_INIT_FAIL   - MAC-PHY initialization is still in progress or failed

/* Writes the given value into the MAC / Phy registers

    Summary:
      Performs a write procedure to the MAC / Phy registers
      <p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

    Description:
      Adjusts the given register by writing the given values.

    Preconditions:
      The client had to be successfully opened with DRV_LAN865X_Open.

    Parameters:
      idx           - the MAC-PHY instance number, starting with 0 for the first instance
      addr          - The 32 Bit register offset
      value         - The 32 Bit register bit value to be written
      protected     - true, enables protected control data transmission (normal + inverted data). false, no protection feature is used
      txCallback    - Pointer to a callback handler. May left NULL
      pTag          - Any pointer. Will be given back in given modifyCallback. May left NULL

    Returns:
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK                - Returned on success
      - TCPIP_MAC_RES_NO_DRIVER         - Given idx parameter is out of range

/* Reads, modifies and writes back the changed value to MAC / Phy registers

    Summary:
      Performs a read, modify, write procedure to the MAC / Phy registers
      <p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

    Description:
      Adjusts the given register by applying values according to the given mask.

    Preconditions:
      The client had to be successfully opened with DRV_LAN865X_Open.

    Parameters:
      idx               - the MAC-PHY instance number, starting with 0 for the first instance
      addr              - The 32 Bit register offset
      value             - The 32 Bit register bit value to be changed. This value will be set to register only if mask on the corresponding position is set to 1
      mask              - The 32 Bit register bit mask. Only Bits set to 1 will be changed accordingly to value
      protected         - true, enables protected control data transmission (normal + inverted data). false, no protection feature is used
      modifyCallback    - Pointer to a callback handler. May left NULL
      pTag              - Any pointer. Will be given back in given modifyCallback. May left NULL
